Library of functions/classes I am working on.
I am working it into some kind of framework or something.
Still needs some documentation. Tried to write self-documenting code.
unless there's a citation for someone else (a link, copyright, etc),
any code here is mine and I release it under the following license:


`COPYRIGHT (c) 2013 kafene.org <http://kafene.org/COPYING>`

`You may do anything with this work that any copyright law would normally`

`restrict, so long as you retain the above notice in all redistributed copies`

`and/or derived works. The works are provided `as-is` with no form of warranty.`




See lib_kafene.php for more details.
